<p>This Ted-Talk is an excellent starting point for understanding why it is important for everyone to come to grips with the advances currently being made in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>The video mainly focuses on the development of the “Singularity”, which is the point where computers become more intelligent than mankind. This sort of AI is often referred to as “General AI”, as opposed to “Narrow AI”.</p>

<p>The difference between general and narrow AI lies in the ability of computer systems to apply intelligence generally across a broad domain of problems as opposed to being confined to a narrowly defined set of problems.</p>

<p>For example, a narrow artificial intelligence system for medical imaging that is used to identify broken bones would be useless for identifying breast cancer.</p>

<p>A more generally intelligent system, however, could be trained to diagnose a broad range of conditions from a variety of medical images.</p>

<p>The “Singularity” is the ultimate in general artificial intelligence, with the ability to learn and solve any number of problems or tasks across any domain of knowledge better than humans.</p>

<p>It is important to note that we already have the technology to apply a multitude of narrow AI applications across a growing number of human activities. This could have much the same impact upon society as a single more generally intelligent system would have.</p>

<p>Indeed the “singularity” need not be realised in order for society to experience the kind of changes mentioned in this video.</p>
